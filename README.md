I'm a bioinformatician involved in NGS data analysis projects (metagenomics, metabarcoding, transcriptomics, epigenomics) on prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral organisms. 

As bioinformatics engineer, I have solid programming skills (Python, R, Bash, Javascript) with good development habits (code versioning with Git, setting up pre-compiled environments with Conda and Singularity, setting up unit tests, etc).

For automated processing I used Snakemake or Nextflow pipelines (efficient, scalable and reproducible).
